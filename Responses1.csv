21 Explain how tenascins influence cell shape growth and migration 22 Is there significant clinical overlap between myopathic EDS and collagen VIâ€“related myopathies?,"Regarding question 21, tenascins influence cell shape and growth by maintaining the integrity of the scaffold in which collagen lays down. They also regulate the stability of elastic fibers.

As for question 22, there is significant clinical overlap between myopathic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and collagen VI-related myopathies.","I don't have information on how tenascins influence cell shape growth and migration. 

There is significant clinical overlap between myopathic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and collagen VI-related myopathies. Myopathic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is associated with mutations in genes encoding collagen VI, leading to muscle weakness and joint hypermobility, similar to collagen VI-related myopathies.

"23 Explain the effect that damaged extracellular matrix structure due to inadequate collagen affects ECM has on the role of acting as an epigenetic informational entity through reduced intracellular signals via distinct cell surface receptors. 24 Explain how tenascins in people with EDS are suppressed during wound healing, nerve regeneration, and tissue involution, and in pathological states including vascular disease, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. 25 What are the definitions of EDS and HSD?","Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by skin hyperelasticity, tissue fragility, poor wound healing, and joint hypermobility. The classical subtype of EDS is caused by mutations in COL5A1, COL5A2, or COL1A1 genes, leading to skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scars, joint hypermobility, and other clinical features. Diagnosis of classical EDS is based on clinical criteria such as skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and specific minor criteria like easy bruising and soft skin.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type IV is characterized by fragile connective tissue, easy bruising, and loose joints. Patients with Type IV EDS may have tight and thin skin with visible veins, and some may paradoxically develop keloids and contractures despite collagen deficiency. In Type IV EDS, the absence of type III collagen leads to skin, aorta, and intestine issues, with only type I collagen being synthesized. The acrogeric form of Type IV EDS has a worse prognosis than the ecchymotic form, with complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation, particularly in the colon and recto-sigmoid junction.","I'm happy to help with your medical question!

For example, classical EDS (EDS I/II) is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, while other subtypes like vascular EDS (EDS IV) have different inheritance patterns.",,30.411946058273315
30 What are the considerations for genetic testing and counseling for EDS and HSD?,"Genetic testing for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome involves evaluating specific genes associated with connective tissue disorders like COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2. The testing is typically done after meeting clinical criteria, and the pathogenicity of detected variants is assessed to confirm the diagnosis. Counseling for genetic testing in EDS should consider the complex genotype and phenotype of the disorder, as well as the potential implications for the individual and their family members.","For genetic testing and counseling for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), consider the following:

* Genetic testing can confirm some but not all types of EDS after clinical criteria are met.
* The prevalence of EDS is estimated at 1 in 5000 live births, and some suggest a higher prevalence as physicians' awareness of the disease improves.
